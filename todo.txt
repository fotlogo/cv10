TODO list:

1. check whether the feature coordinate and segmentation coordinate are matched(each row in image is y, column is x)
2. run experiment on condor to tune the training parameter
3. cut off the attributes with so few positive training samples
4. use voc2008 to train, it is much bigger
5. calculate the histogram of the hierarchy
